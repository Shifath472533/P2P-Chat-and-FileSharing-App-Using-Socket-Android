# Description

<h2> Peer to Peer chat and file sharing aplication using Socket Programming in Android </h2>

<h3> Basic Features: </h3>


1. This is a peer to peer chatting and file sharing application, we decided to create both server and client features each 
side.
  
2. In the application, there is an portion <b> Your IP Address </b> where the user can see his/her device's ip address. 
Basically it is the address the connected router gave to the device.Also there are 3 options which the user have to fill. 

3. <b> Your Port No. </b> requires the port number of user's server where s/he want others to connect. Then <b> Receiver's
IP Address </b> requires the ip address of the device of other user with whom the user want to connect. <b> Receiver's Port No. </b> 
requires the port number of the server of other user.

4. By clicking the <b> Connect </b> button, user will move to the chat and file sharing portion where the server of user side will start  to connect to a client user on the other end and client will send request to connect to the other user's server. If other user also click connect button then both  the server and client will be connected to each other by given port number. And then they can    start chatting and file sharing.
